### Description 
The OpenPrinting ecosystem includes multiple utilities for driverless printing, protocol implementation, and printer management, with components written in Go and Python. These projects, such as `ipp-usb`, `goipp`, `pycups`, and `pyppd`, currently lack fuzz testing, leaving them vulnerable to undetected bugs and security issues.  

This project integrates these polyglot OpenPrinting components into [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz), enabling continuous large-scale fuzzing. The work involves evaluating existing tests, improving coverage, identifying suitable fuzzing targets, developing fuzz harnesses, and upstreaming the integrations. The goal is to expand OSS-Fuzz coverage for OpenPrinting, strengthening the overall security and reliability of its ecosystem.
